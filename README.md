# GeoSpatial-project
The data set of this project is GPS trajectory dataset that was collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) Geolife project by   
182 users in a period of over five years (from April 2007 to August 2012).  
In this project I make use of Geopandas, matplotlin, seaborn to find insights and visualize my dataset.   
Important:  the data set is too big, so the raw data and a csv file I created with the data can be found at my
